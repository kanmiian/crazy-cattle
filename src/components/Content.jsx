        <p>
          Crazy Cattle 3D is an exhilarating battle royale game that puts you in control of explosive sheep 
          competing for survival across three unique environments. Unlike traditional battle royale games, 
          Crazy Cattle 3D focuses on physics-based gameplay, where success comes from mastering momentum, 
          collision, and strategic positioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this unique gaming experience, you'll find yourself in a world where physics reigns supreme. 
          Every movement, collision, and interaction is governed by a sophisticated physics engine that 
          creates unpredictable and hilarious moments. The game combines the strategic depth of battle 
          royale with the chaotic fun of physics-based gameplay, creating an experience that's both 
          challenging and entertaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets Crazy Cattle 3D apart is its focus on skill-based combat rather than weapon collection 
          or resource management. Your success depends entirely on your ability to master the game's unique 
          movement system and understand the physics of momentum and collision. This pure approach to 
          competitive gaming has attracted players seeking an authentic challenge and genuine improvement 
          in their skills.

          How to Play
        </h3>
        <div className="how-to-play">
          <p>
            Getting started with Crazy Cattle 3D is simple, but mastering the game requires practice and 
            skill development. Here's what you need to know:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Movement Controls:</strong> Use WASD keys for movement, with W and S controlling 
            forward and backward motion, and A and D for strafing left and right.</li>
            <li><strong>Direction Control:</strong> Use your mouse to control the direction your sheep 
            is facing, allowing for precise aiming and movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> Press the spacebar to activate your sheep's explosive 
            collision ability, which must be timed perfectly for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Momentum Building:</strong> Gain speed by moving downhill, then use that momentum 
            to launch attacks or escape dangerous situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Collision Timing:</strong> The physics system rewards precision timing ‚Äì hitting 
            opponents at the right angle can send them flying off the map, while poor timing might leave 
            you vulnerable to counterattacks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A successful strategy often involves a combination of patience and opportunistic aggression. 
            Early in matches, focus on survival and positioning rather than eliminations. Learn the map 
            layouts to identify advantage points and hazard zones. As the play area shrinks, be prepared 
            to engage more aggressively with remaining opponents.

        <div className="tips">
          <p>
            Mastering Crazy Cattle 3D takes time and practice. Here are some tips to help you improve 
            your gameplay:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Momentum is Key:</strong> Learn to use momentum to your advantage. Build up speed 
            on downhill sections to launch powerful attacks or make quick escapes.</li>
            <li><strong>Map Knowledge:</strong> Study map layouts and identify strategic positions. Knowing 
            the terrain is crucial for survival and success.</li>
            <li><strong>Timing Matters:</strong> Practice timing your explosive abilities perfectly. A 
            well-timed collision can eliminate an opponent instantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn from Others:</strong> Watch and learn from experienced players. Observe 
            their movement patterns and timing of collisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Aware:</strong> Keep an eye on the shrinking play area and plan your 
            movements accordingly. Being caught outside the safe zone can be fatal.</li>
            <li><strong>Patience Pays:</strong> Sometimes the best strategy is to wait and observe. Let 
            other players eliminate each other before engaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> Consistent practice is the key to improvement. Spend 
            time in practice mode to refine your skills.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Remember that in Crazy Cattle 3D, victory often comes not to the most aggressive sheep, but 
            to the most strategic one. Develop your skills, learn from your mistakes, and gradually you'll 
            see your performance improve.
